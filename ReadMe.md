The Stanford Geospatial Center at Branner Earth Sciences Library has got some great activities planned for **GIS Day 2015, at Stanford**. We've lined up some amazing speakers who are working on the bleeding edge of geospatial technologies and volunteered geographic information, as well as workshops, games, a great lunch menu, (H)Mappy Hour and more for a full day of action that will leave the GeoNerd Nation inspired and challenged to do more with "where"!

**GIS Day** is a globally recognized day of observance, dedicated to celebrating the value of geospatial technologies in the examination and stewardship of our world. Geospatial technologies touch every part of our lives.

@ A Glance:

*   9:30am - 5pm **Talks**: Workshops, Demos and festivities!

##9:30am-10am - Coffee and Welcome (Hartley Conference Center)

##Track 1: Invited Speakers and Lightning Talks
 
###**10am-10:50am - "The Open Mapping Revolution" Alex Barth (Data Team Lead, [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/))**  
Open data commons like OpenStreetMap or OpenAddresses fundamentally change how we create and share geospatial data. Open source communities curate global geospatial datasets of immense value, all in the open. This democratizes data production, it spurs innovation and it stimulates economic growth. This trend also rapidly undermines businesses built on proprietary data licensing and it duplicates traditional government GIS efforts. In this talk I'll dive into OpenStreetMap and what it means for the future of maps specifically from a business and government perspective. I'll bring examples of how OpenStreetMap is gaining traction across all sectors and show why this change matters for your work.   
*Alex leads the data team at Mapbox. Mapbox provides tailored location services to companies like Foursquare, Github, Pinterest, and Instacart and builds a big part of its products on open source software and data. Aside from his job at Mapbox he helps grow OpenStreetMap as Vice President of OpenStreetMap's US chapter.*  

###**11am - 11:50am - "Maps And Technology On The Edge" Eric Rodenbeck (CEO, [Stamen Design](http://stamen.com/))**  


*Eric is the Founder, CEO, and Creative Director of Stamen Designs. Eric Rodenbeck came to San Francisco in 1994, lured by a deep curiosity for the budding internet-based industry in the city. Twenty years later, Eric’s passion for cities, design, and technology has made him a both a local and international leader at the intersection of all three.*

###1:30pm - 2:20pm "Esri and the zombie apocalypse" Brendan O'Neill (Education Specialist, Patterns and Practices, [Esri](http://www.esri.com/)) 

*Brendan support Esri's education community by identifying and promoting best practices for the ArcGIS platform in K12 schools, colleges and universities, libraries and museums, and research institutions with the goal of encouraging educational organizations to adopt spatial technology in order to improve research and learning outcomes as well as administrative efficiency.*



###2:30pm - 3:30pm "Google Expeditions, 360 Imagery and VR for Education" Dr. John Bailey (Program Manager [Geo Education, Google Inc.](https://www.google.com/earth/outreach/index.html))    
  
*Dr. John Bailey is a former volcanologist turned Googler. As an undergraduate he studying physics & space science at the University of Kent at Canterbury and Penn State University, but decided there were limited fieldwork opportunities in space. So he switched to the far safer field of volcanology & remote sensing, moving to Hawaii to complete a MS and PhD. To balance the years in the tropics, fate then decided to send John to Alaska as a postdoc with the Alaska Volcano Observatory at the the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Finally after almost two decades in academia he decided he needed a new challenge and joined the Google Earth Outreach team as Program Manager for Geo Education. John loves to travel and explore new places and landscapes for himself. To date he has visited over fifty countries on six continents and will visit his seventh later this year. His goal is to teach knowledge, understanding and stewardship of the planet we live on through the use of Google’s Geo tools and other innovative technologies.*

###3:30pm - 4pm [Google Expeditions](https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/) Demo

Imagine visiting the bottom of the sea or the surface of Mars in an afternoon. With Expeditions, teachers can take their classes on immersive virtual journeys to bring their lessons to life. **John Bailey** will provide a hand's on demonstration of Google's new Expeditions platform for VR in Education.
